    <h5>Sponge cake</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F/200C.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs and the caster sugar at high speed until they whiten and triple in volume.</li>
        <li>Add the sifted flour and, using the flat beater, mix at low speed for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Grease an 8-inch (20cm) round cake pan with high edges and sprinkle with flour.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan and turn the pan on itself get rid of the excess flour.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the mold and bake for 12 minutes at 400F/200C, then lower the temperature to 350F/180C, 
            and bake for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and wait about 10 minutes before unmolding.</li>
        <li>Unmold and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h5>Meringue</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 210F/100C.</li>
        <li>Using a large black pen, trace a circle of the same size as the sponge pan (8 inches/20cm) on a parchment paper, 
            turn it over and place it on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Add the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt over the egg whites and beat them.</li>
        <li>When the mixture begins to foam, add the caster sugar gradually.</li>
        <li>Once the whites are stiff and shiny, stop whipping and fold in the icing sugar delicately with a spatula, without breaking 
            the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Using a pastry bag and a large plain pastry tube, pipe the meringue in a circular motion, so that it fills the circle painted 
            on the parchment paper on a single layer.</li>
        <li>With the rest of the meringue, make some meringues discs.</li>
        <li>Bake for two hours at 210F/100C.</li>
        <li>After two hours of baking, increase the oven temperature to 270F/130C, and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside until they cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h5>Cream</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the heavy whipping cream in the freezer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream into the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Beat the whipped cream at medium speed for about 10 minutes by incorporating the icing sugar gradually.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h5>Assembly of the chajá</h5>
    <ol>
    <li>Drain the peach halves and reserve their syrup in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Slice 4 halved peaches (to cover the top of the cake) and cut the remaining peaches in small cubes.</li>
    <li>Slice the sponge cake in 3 equal layers.</li>
    <li>Place the first layer of sponge cake in a 12-inch (30cm) pie dish.</li>
    <li>Brush the first layer of sponge cake with the reserved peach syrup.</li>
    <li>Then spread the dulce de leche with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Place the second layer of sponge cake and brush it with the syrup. Cover with a generous layer of whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Cover the whipped cream with half of the diced peaches.</li>
    <li>Place the meringue disk on the peaches and press lightly.</li>
    <li>Cover again with whipped cream and place the rest of the diced peaches on top.</li>
    <li>Place the third layer of sponge cake on top and press lightly so all the fillings get compacted.</li>
    <li>Cover all the surface of the cake with whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Break the small circles of meringues and carefully glue them on all sides of the cake.</li>
    <li>Arrange the sliced peaches carefully on the surface of the cake.</li>
    <li>Pipe all the remaining cream with a pastry bag with a fluted tip to draw a tube around the top of the cake.</li>
