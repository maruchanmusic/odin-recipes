          <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>2 onion, chopped</li>
          <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
          <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>

          <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

          <li>¾ cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
          <li>2 hard-cooked eggs</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>24 empanada pastry rounds</li>
          <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, 
          about 8 minutes. Drain. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into cubes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet and cook onion and green onions until softened, about 5 minutes. 
          Add bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. 
          Season with paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt.</li>
        <li>Remove beef mixture from heat; add potatoes and olives. Stir in chopped hard-cooked eggs; set filling aside to cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly grease with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Place an empanada pastry round on a flat surface and lightly wet the edges with warm water. Put a large tablespoon of cooled filling
           in the center and fold dough over. Seal edges by pressing with a fork. Repeat with remaining rounds and filling. 
           Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
